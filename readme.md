## Use Case
#### How many times have you wanted an opinion about what you wear before you're out from either people you trust OR total strangers!
#### Well now you can!
### Introducing CHANGING ROOM - Your one stop shop on getting an opinion within seconds.
1. Just shoot a quick selfie and upload it on the app.
2. Within seconds have people swipe left or right (tinder-esqe) to tell you how they like what you're wearing.
3. The feedback could be more detailed than a simple yes or no.
  * 140 Character Comment
  * 1-5 Star Rating System
  * Simple Swipe Left / Right for No / Yes
4. Changing Room is also EPHEMERAL meaning your photos disappear after you got the opinion you're looking for.
