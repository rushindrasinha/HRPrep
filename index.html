		<h3>Watch the world change around you!</h3>
		<p>Changing Room is a mobile-based app which provides the user with an easy alternative to the traditional method of asking for outfit advice.</p>
		<p>Typically a person tries on a clothing item, snaps a photo, and then sends it to a group chat of 5 of their closest friends and proceeds to wait all day for their expert critiques.<br>With Changing Room the user simply takes a photo, uploads it to the app, and within minutes has hundreds of critiques, ratings, and a better idea on whether or not to purchase the outfit.</p>
